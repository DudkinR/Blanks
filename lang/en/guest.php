        In recent years, security issues in the work of atomic energy are becoming more and more relevant.
         In this regard, there is a need to create new systems and technologies that would ensure safety and prevent possible errors.
        </p> <p> 
        Operational work in the nuclear energy requires employees of high concentration and accuracy.
         As part of this work, it is necessary to monitor many parameters and ensure uninterrupted operation of the equipment.
          Errors in this area can lead to catastrophic consequences.
        </p> <p> 
        For more than 70 years of work in the nuclear energy, many events have been studied that led to errors and
          non -standard situations. Both indigenous and direct reasons were identified that led to these events.
        </p> <p> 
        Based on the experience gained, a new system of electronic document and an electronic switch form was developed.
         It is based on methods for preventing errors, as well as on the analysis of operation experience.
         The new system provides work without errors and with verification of the result.
        </p> <p> 
        One of the main features of the new system is its electronic format. This avoids errors associated with improper filling out paper documents.
        </p> <p> 
        The creation of a new system of electronic document and an electronic switch form is a critical step in ensuring the effectiveness of operational work and not only. The development of a new system was based on the experience of operational work and the study of many thousands of events related to the indigenous and direct causes of errors that occurred during operation.
        </p> <p> 
        The importance of creating a new system of electronic document and an electronic switch form is that this will avoid many errors and problems that arise with manual filling out documents and switching forms. Will exclude the pass of the steps of action that are critical for the work.

        </p> <p> 
        One of the key methods used to create a new system were methods for preventing errors.
         These methods allow you to prevent errors at all stages of work with documents and switching forms, starting with filling and ending with checking the results.
        </p> <p> 
        The study of operating experience was one of the main stages when creating a new system.
         Many thousands of events were examined, which occurred as a result of errors when filling out documents and switching forms.
         The performance of work on prepared documents, and not from memory, turned out to be so an effective means of accelerating work, which is considered in the nuclear energy as the main method of work.
          </p> 
          
          <h3>
          Any switching that contains more than three operations should be performed according to the switching form.

        The idea of everyday use of the tested approaches and methods probably appeared from practical experience and observations of how these methods and approaches help solve problems and achieve their goals. The author of the idea came across everyday tasks and problems that were successfully solved due to the use of methods and approaches used in his production.

        To implement the project, the author needed to systematize and streamline these methods and approaches so that they could be easily used in everyday life. This included the creation of lists, programs, tables or other tools that helped the author better understand and apply these methods and approaches.
        
        The use of the tested approaches and methods in private life has become very useful, as they can help achieve their goals and manage various objectives and projects more efficiently. In addition, the systematization and ordering of these methods and approaches made them more affordable and simple for use, which can help many people in everyday life and their work.      Изучение рынка: какие были первые исследования, как определялись потребности потенциальных клиентов и конкуренты.
        Study of the market is an important stage in the launch of any business, so conducting research allows you to determine potential customers and their needs.

        The first studies conducted in production were aimed at optimizing technological processes and improving product quality. However, with the development of computer technology and software, research methods began to be used in other areas, for example, in programming.
        
        In addition, the use of computers and smartphones at home has become widespread, which opened up new opportunities for automation and optimization of everyday tasks, such as cooking and household work.
        
        Freenscers, developers and small enterprises that use typical tasks can become potential customers. The leaders of such enterprises seek to avoid human mistakes and perform work quickly and efficiently, so automation and optimization of processes can be of considerable interest for them.
        
        In general, conducting research allows you to determine the potential audience and its needs, which is an important step in the development and promotion of the product in the market.
        
        The implementation of the entire logic of the program and its implementation was performed by one person, the author of the program, which had its advantages and disadvantages.

Advantages:

     Control. The author of the program has full control over the development process, which allows him to fully control the quality of the code, the choice of technologies used and their compatibility, as well as check each step in development.

     Development speed. One developer can quickly realize his idea and bring it to the market. I did not waste time coordinating with other developers, and also did not waste time training for beginners or working on projects of other developers.

     The uniformity of the code. When developing a program by one person, the author of the program, to achieve a single code style and simplified its reading and support in the future.

Flaws:

     Limited opportunities. One person can be limited in his knowledge and experience. This can lead to the limited capabilities of the program or the inefficiency of its work.

     The risk of lack of support. If the author of the program suddenly abandons its development, this can lead to problems in its support and further development.

      Financing only from the author is useful in cases where the project or research is a personal hobby or hobby, which the author wants to implement without involving external means.
      My product development experience: idea, difficulties and successes

I worked in a production company for many years and hone my ideas and developments in order to ultimately create my first product. The idea was to tear out something new from production, which would be unique and corresponded to the needs of the market.

The first stage that I passed was to study the market and determine the needs of customers. I studied the trends in the market and conducted research to find out which products will be in demand on the market. Then I started the design and creation of prototypes to make sure that my product corresponds to the needs of customers.

However, some difficulties arose at this stage. I faced problems in the process of creating prototypes and testing, and I had to spend a lot of time and effort to solve these problems.

But I did not give up and continued to work on my product. I used my rich experience and knowledge to improve the design and functionality of the product. I also worked in a team with other specialists to get valuable tips and ideas.

Finally, my product was ready to launch the market. I was sure of its quality and potential in the market. I conducted marketing research and began to sell my product.

Today my product is successfully sold in the market, and I am proud of my work.
